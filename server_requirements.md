** API Guidelines

   When building your API, try to adhere to these rules for easy compatibility with other groups:

- REST API calls may be prefixed. ie. <http://service_address/api/author/{AUTHOR_ID}/posts/>
- Document your service address, port, hostname, prefix(if used), and the username/password for HTTP
    Basic Auth(if used) in your README so that HTTP clients can connect to your API.
